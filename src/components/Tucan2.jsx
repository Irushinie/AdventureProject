                        <p className="tp2">Travel doesnâ€™t have to be expensive - and at Tucan Travel we can offer you
                        fantastic value for money, as well as
                    unforgettable once-in-a-lifetime experiences, designed by experts with your specific needs at heart.<br></br><br></br>
                    As a specialist adventure tour operator with global reach,
                    we are adept at building strong business relationships with local suppliers of accommodation,
                    transport and local guides. We select the best providers and negotiate
                     hard to get you the best price, while taking care to support and sustain local business in a fair and ethical way.<br></br><br></br>
                     Adventure travel offers a more authentic way to explore a destination - and that goes for the accommodation too. 
                     Why stay in some beige, vanilla hotel when you could enjoy somewhere with genuine colour and flavour? 
                     We specifically seek out the locally-owned character hotels and avoid the generic international chains.</p>
